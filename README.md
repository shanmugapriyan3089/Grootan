Create a simple application (Use any language) that fetches tweets
with the word ‘corona' in it in the past 5 days
● Use the twitter API - Read documentation
● Store the top 10 tweets with the most number of retweets in a file
named ‘retweets.json' with just the screen_name and retweet counts
● Share the final source code via github and screenshots of file creation
and its contents

For the above coding challenge I have done upto the creation of top 5 tweets which I created using twitter api and tweepy.since I used hash tags for different countries that shows in above coding
